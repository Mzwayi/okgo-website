# Hero Background Image Recommendations for OKgo

## Current Implementation
The hero banner now supports a background image located at `/public/hero-supply-chain-bg.jpg`

## Recommended Image Characteristics

### Theme Options (Choose One):
1. **Network Connectivity & Data Flow** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
   - Abstract network of connected nodes with glowing lines
   - Data streams and digital pathways
   - Represents real-time tracking and connectivity across Africa

2. **Supply Chain Visualization**
   - Aerial view of shipping containers, trucks, or logistics hubs
   - Modern warehouse with automated systems
   - Cross-border transport routes on a map

3. **Technology & AI Focus**
   - Digital dashboard with charts and metrics
   - IoT sensors and tracking devices
   - AI-powered analytics visualization

### Technical Specifications:
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080, preferably 2560x1440 or higher
- **Format**: JPG or WebP for best performance
- **File Size**: Under 500KB (optimize for web)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or wider landscape orientation

### Visual Requirements:
- **Dark areas**: Ensure some darker regions for text overlay readability
- **High contrast**: Avoid too many bright whites that compete with text
- **Professional**: Modern, sleek, enterprise-grade appearance
- **African context**: If possible, subtle references to African geography or logistics

### Color Palette:
- Should complement OKgo's yellow brand color (#eab308)
- Blues, teals, and darker tones work well with yellow overlays
- Avoid competing yellows or oranges in the background

## Implementation Notes:
- The image will have gradient overlays applied for text readability
- Text shadows are added for better contrast
- Buttons have enhanced shadows and backdrop blur for modern appearance

## Fallback:
If no custom image is available, the component falls back to the previous gradient background.

## Next Steps:
1. Source or create the background image
2. Save as `/public/hero-supply-chain-bg.jpg`
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Optimize file size if needed
